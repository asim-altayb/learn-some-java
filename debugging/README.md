# Objects

Calling `getHelloWorldGenerator` on the HelloGetter object needs to return an instance of a `HelloWorldGenerator` object. This has 1 method `getHelloWorld()` that returns the String "Hello World"

To make the tests pass you need to write the `HelloWorldGenerator.java` class with the method that returns the right value.
