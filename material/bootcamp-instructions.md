4. I will create you an account with Pluralsight that you should be able to log into using your university email address.
5. I'll also invite you to join our Slack group chat - sign in and say hello.

## Getting yourself ready

1. Complete the quiz to assess your current level - Click the "Check Now" button here - https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/java
2. It would be good to post your score to the Slack channel, but if you don't feel about to, you can just send it to me in slack as a Direct Message - https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212281468-Direct-messages-and-group-DMs
3. Unless Pluralsight is telling you that you are Proficient in Java then you should start on the "Absolute Beginner" section below. 

## Absolute Beginner

If you don't feel at all confident in Java you may want to start from the very beginning. Here is how we recommend you start. 

1. :cinema: VIDEO watch **Course Overview** and **Introduction and Setting up...** in Pluralsight. See [my notes on the videos](pluralsight-notes.md)
2. :construction_worker: TASK (If you haven't already) install Java and an IDE like instructed in the video. 
3. :construction_worker: TASK As a break from this follow the instructions in this video to set up your machine for running the real exercises - https://youtu.be/P1nz1CMs90g

If you have had any problems getting your Java environment or Gradle/Exercises set up - let us know in Slack

4. :runner: EXERCISE Get the "return" exercise running as shown in the video above.
5. :cinema: VIDEO watch **Variables, Data Types and Math Operators** and **Conditional Logic, Looping and Arrays**
6. :runner: EXERCISE Complete the `types-and-maths` exercise that you downloaded when following the instructions in Task 3 above. 
7. :cinema: VIDEO watch watch **Conditional Logic, Looping and Arrays**
8. :runner: EXERCISE Complete exercises 4 to 9 ('if' to 'calculator')

If you have any problems during these, let us know on slack

[Optional] if you want to test your knowledge you could install the SoloLearn app or us it only. If you've one the above you should be able to complete the "Basic Concepts" section here - http://www.sololearn.com/Play/Java/#

## Moving onto OO

1. :cinema: VIDEO watch **Representing complex types with Objects**
2. :runner: EXERCISE Complete exercise 10 and 11 (objects and object-array)
1. :cinema: VIDEO watch **Class initialisers and contructors**
2. :runner: EXERCISE go back to exercise 11 and remove the `setNumber()` method and instead use a constructor - check that the tests still pass.
