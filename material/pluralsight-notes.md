# Java Fundamentals

## Setting up your environment

- If you use an IDE then a lot of the stuff about JDK vs JRE and installation can be hidden from you. However it is still very useful to understand this. When we start using tools like Continuous Integration and Automated Testing in 2nd year modules you will need to understand this sort of thing.
- Netbeans and Eclipse are available in the Computer Science labs. However, I prefer IntelliJ. As the video says, it really doesn't matter, although you may need to google how to do specific things in a particular IDE if you use different ones. 
- You don't really need to watch the demos for both IntelliJ and Netbeans.

## Creating a simple app
